    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Coffee Morning</h2>
<p>The alarm.</p>
<p>Four beeps, high then low. 6:47 AM. Three minutes before the main alarm, the one that said <em>get up now</em>. Eleanor's hand found the clock on the nightstand without looking. The button under her thumb. Silence.</p>
<p>Cold air on her face. December pressed against the windows. She swung her legs out, and her feet met carpet instead of the expected chill. Good. The slippers were—where? She looked down. Already on her feet.</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Stop.*</p>
<p>The Day Book. She reached for it. Brown leather, worn at the corners from six years of this. Her handwriting from last night, blue ink, still sharp:</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Wednesday, 11 December 2024*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 6:50 AM: Main alarm. Get up.*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 7:00 AM: Bathroom. Dress (clothes on chair).*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 7:15 AM: Kitchen. Kettle on. Two pieces of toast. Butter only.*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 7:30 AM: Check Day Book for morning.*</p>
<p>She read it twice. The slippers—already on. Right.</p>
<p>The bathroom mirror showed a thin face, Eleanor's face, with steel-gray hair pulled back. Sixty-eight. The blouse and skirt waited on the chair—navy, sensible, the kind that said <em>normal day, nothing unusual</em>. She'd laid them out last night. Weather checked—rain, cold—what would she need for...?</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 10:00 AM: Coffee morning at the village hall (bring scones—made yesterday, in blue tin).*</p>
<p>The blouse buttons. Her fingers felt thick. First button. Second. Third. Gap. She'd—no. Start over. Again. Again. Fourth attempt: they lined up.</p>
<p>Keys, purse, glasses. All in their places. The Day Book went into her handbag. Always the Day Book.</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 7:30 AM: No problems this morning.*</p>
<p>She wrote it in the margin, pen pressed hard enough to indent the page. Proof. If she wrote it down, it was true.</p>
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
<p>The kitchen smelled of yesterday's baking. Butter on toast, tea in the pot. The radio murmured something about traffic. Eleanor ate standing up, reading the Day Book entries she'd already read three times. The words made sense. They had to make sense.</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 10:00 AM: Coffee morning.*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Bring: Scones (blue tin, counter).*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Topic: Church roof fund.*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Remember: Sarah's grandchildren.*</p>
<p>Sarah's grandchildren. Two? Three? The names were—</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p>Focus. The scones. Blue tin, right there on the counter. She'd made them yesterday. The recipe was... somewhere. In her head? No. The notebook. The old notebook with Gerald's handwriting in the margins. <em>Too much sugar, love. Cut it by half.</em></p>
<p>The notebook wasn't on its shelf.</p>
<p>When had she moved it? Yesterday? Last week? The kitchen drawers opened and closed, opened and closed. Nothing. The cupboards. The pantry. Nothing. The notebook—the one she'd used for forty years—</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Focus.</p>
<p>The tin. The scones. That's what mattered. She checked the clock. 9:42 AM. Time to leave. She'd need her coat. Where was her coat?</p>
<p>The hallway. On its hook. Right where it always was.</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 9:45 AM: Leaving for coffee morning. Coat, scones, keys, purse, glasses. Everything. No problems.*</p>
<p>She wrote it in the Day Book. Proof.</p>
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
<p>The village hall smelled of instant coffee and the particular staleness of church basements. Women clustered around tables, steam rising from mugs. Eleanor recognized the faces. Names...</p>
<p>"Eleanor! You made it!"</p>
<p>Sarah. That was Sarah. Blonde hair, always smiling. Sarah with the grandchildren whose names Eleanor absolutely knew.</p>
<p>"I brought scones." Eleanor held up the tin.</p>
<p>"Lovely! Set them on the table there." Sarah's hand on her arm. "How have you been? We haven't seen you in weeks."</p>
<p>Weeks? Had it been weeks? The last coffee morning—when was that? November? October?</p>
<p>"I've been well, thank you." The words came out smooth, practiced. "And you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you know. The usual chaos. My daughter's little ones have been staying with us while she's renovating. You remember—Lily and Emma?"</p>
<p>Lily and Emma. Right. Two grandchildren. The names clicked into place like a door finally locking.</p>
<p>"Of course," Eleanor said. "How are they managing?"</p>
<p>Sarah laughed and launched into a story about paint colors and contractors. Eleanor's face did what faces do: smiled, nodded, made the small noises that meant <em>listening, engaged, present</em>. Inside, she was checking. Had that response made sense? Should she ask about the renovation? What had Sarah just said about paint?</p>
<p>Her throat was dry. Her cheeks felt hot. She replayed the last sentence in her mind. It had made sense. Hadn't it?</p>
<p>"—and I said to her, 'Darling, if you want teal, have teal,' but she's convinced it won't go with the fixtures. What do you think, Eleanor?"</p>
<p>What did she think about what? Paint. Teal. Fixtures. Say something normal. Something that fits.</p>
<p>"I think," Eleanor said carefully, "she should choose what makes her happy."</p>
<p>Sarah beamed. "Exactly! That's what I told her."</p>
<p>The conversation moved on. Eleanor's hands wrapped around her mug—tea, two sugars, just like always—and the heat helped. Grounded. She was here. The village hall. Wednesday morning. Coffee with the ladies. Normal. Everything normal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parrish was talking about the church roof fund. The estimates were higher than expected. Eleanor knew she should care about this. The church had been part of her life for forty years. She'd served on committees, organized bazaars, helped count collection money with Gerald on Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>Collection money.</p>
<p>Numbers in neat columns. Gerald's handwriting. The special ledger they kept locked in the study.</p>
<p>The study—when had she last been in there? The door stayed closed now. She couldn't remember opening it. Couldn't remember the last time she'd sat at Gerald's desk or touched the filing cabinet where they'd kept everything organized.</p>
<p>Five years. Gerald had been gone five years in March.</p>
<p>Five years, and the study door stayed closed.</p>
<p>"Eleanor? Are you all right?"</p>
<p>She blinked. Sarah was looking at her. They were all looking at her.</p>
<p>"Fine," Eleanor said. "Sorry. What were you saying?"</p>
<p>"I was just asking if you'd be interested in helping with the Christmas bazaar this year. You used to organize the cake stall, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Used to. Past tense. When had that stopped?</p>
<p>"I—yes. I'd be happy to help." The words came out before she could think. Was that true? Could she manage a cake stall? Pricing, making change, remembering who'd ordered what?</p>
<p>Making change.</p>
<p>Her mind went blank trying to picture it. Someone hands her a twenty-pound note. The cakes are three pounds each. How much change? The numbers wouldn't form. They were there—twenty, three—but they wouldn't connect.</p>
<p>"Wonderful!" Sarah was writing something down. "I'll put you on the list."</p>
<p>Eleanor's mug was empty. When had she finished the tea? The other women were standing, gathering coats and bags. The meeting—already over? She checked her watch. 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>Had she really sat here for an hour and fifteen minutes? Where had the time gone?</p>
<p>She collected her coat. The tin—where was the tin? Empty, on the serving table. Right. She'd brought scones. People had eaten them. Everything normal.</p>
<p>In the car park, Eleanor stood beside her car and stared at the keys in her hand. Which key opened the door? The silver one. No—the black one. She'd done this a thousand times. Ten thousand times. The muscle memory should just—</p>
<p>The black key fit. The door unlocked.</p>
<p>She sat in the driver's seat and her hands found the steering wheel, the familiar worn leather. Start the car. Reverse out. Drive home. She'd done this route hundreds of times. The roads would know the way even if she...</p>
<p>Even if she what?</p>
<p>Eleanor drove home carefully, ten miles under the speed limit, both hands on the wheel. The countryside slipped past. Fields she recognized. The old mill. The bend in the road where the oak tree grew at an angle. All familiar.</p>
<p>All terrifyingly strange.</p>
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
<p>Rose Cottage looked exactly as it should. Honey-colored stone, thatched roof, the climbing rose that had finally gone dormant for winter. Home. Forty-three years of home.</p>
<p>Inside, everything was in its place because she'd made sure of it. Labels on every drawer. Lists on every surface. Keys on their hook. The Day Book in her bag.</p>
<p>She made tea and sat at the kitchen table, staring at nothing.</p>
<p>The coffee morning had been fine. She'd managed. She'd seemed normal.</p>
<p>But she wasn't normal.</p>
<p>And the effort of pretending—the constant monitoring of every word, every gesture, every facial expression—had left her exhausted.</p>
<p>Eleanor opened the Day Book and wrote:</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 11:30 AM: Home from coffee morning. Went well. Talked to Sarah and Mrs. Parrish. Everything fine. No problems.*</p>
<p>The lie sat there in blue ink.</p>

        <div class="chapter" id="chapter2">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Diagnosis</h2>
<p>The study door stayed closed.</p>
<p>Eleanor walked past it every day. Sometimes her hand touched the knob. Sometimes she stood there, not quite opening it, not quite walking away.</p>
<p>Today, Thursday, December 12th, she opened it.</p>
<p>The room smelled of dust and old paper. Gerald's coat still hung on the back of the door. His reading glasses still sat on the desk. His filing cabinets still lined the wall, each drawer labeled in her neat handwriting from decades ago.</p>
<p>Eleanor stood in the doorway and breathed.</p>
<p>The desk. Oak, heavy, worn smooth by years of Gerald's hands. She crossed to it and sat in his chair. The leather creaked—a sound she remembered, a sound that still meant <em>Gerald's place</em>.</p>
<p>The filing cabinet drawer marked CURRENT ACCOUNTS opened with the particular metal-on-metal sound that had been part of Wednesday nights for forty years. Inside: manila folders. Farm business. Recent years. Her handwriting on some labels, David's on others.</p>
<p>She pulled out the top file.</p>
<p>December 2024 — Tenant payments.</p>
<p>Inside: receipts, bank statements, correspondence. Numbers that should make sense. Income from the three tenant farmers who leased Gerald's fields. Expenses for property maintenance. The mathematics of keeping a dead man's legacy running.</p>
<p>Eleanor spread the papers across the desk. Focused.</p>
<p>The most recent receipt: Farm field repairs, £347.50.</p>
<p>Before that: Fence replacement, £230.00.</p>
<p>The numbers sat there. Waiting. She'd done this kind of accounting automatically for forty years. Farm accounts. Household expenses. Gerald did the physical work; she did the mathematics.</p>
<p>She used to look at these numbers and understand the story they told. Healthy livestock, necessary maintenance, good cash flow. The numbers had been a language she spoke fluently.</p>
<p>Now they were just shapes.</p>
<p>She tried adding them up. £347.50 plus £230.00. That should be—</p>
<p>Her mind went blank. The numbers sat there, refusing to connect. She'd done this kind of arithmetic automatically for forty years. Now she couldn't make her brain perform the simplest addition.</p>
<p>She tried again. £347.50 plus £230.00.</p>
<p>Five hundred something. It had to be five hundred something. But exactly what?</p>
<p>Her hands started shaking. She put the pen down and pressed her palms flat against the desk. Gerald's desk. The desk where they'd sat together every Wednesday night, going through the accounts, Gerald doing the figures and Eleanor checking them, both of them working in comfortable partnership.</p>
<p>Wednesday nights. The filing cabinet drawer. The particular sound of metal on metal. Gerald's teasing voice: <em>You're better at this than I am, love. Admit it.</em></p>
<p>She'd laughed. <em>I just like things tidy.</em></p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• You like things perfect. There's a difference.*</p>
<p>He'd been right. She did like things perfect. She'd taken pride in the accounts, in keeping every number precise, in knowing exactly where the farm stood financially at any given moment.</p>
<p>And now she sat here unable to add £347.50 and £230.00.</p>
<p>Eleanor closed the ledger and put it back in the drawer. She'd finish this later. When her mind was clearer. When she'd had more tea. When she wasn't so tired.</p>
<p>She left the study and closed the door behind her.</p>
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
<p>Grace arrived at 2:00 PM exactly. Fifty-nine years old, practical shoes, steel-gray hair cut short, the kind of competence that made everything around her feel manageable. Forty years of friendship. Forty years of knowing each other's kitchens, children, sorrows.</p>
<p>"Kettle on?" Grace asked, already hanging her coat.</p>
<p>"Always."</p>
<p>They settled at the kitchen table with tea and the biscuits Eleanor had bought—not made, bought—from the shop. Shop-bought biscuits. She never used to serve shop-bought anything.</p>
<p>"How are you?" Grace asked. The question had weight. Grace's questions always had weight.</p>
<p>"Fine. Keeping busy."</p>
<p>"The house looks immaculate. You've been cleaning?"</p>
<p>"Just the usual." Eleanor sipped her tea. "How's Richard?"</p>
<p>Grace launched into updates about her husband, her children, her granddaughter who'd just started university. Eleanor made the right sounds, asked the right questions. Her face did what faces do when you've been friends for forty years.</p>
<p>Inside, she was checking. Should she remember which granddaughter? Grace had three. Or was it four? The names were there somewhere, but Eleanor couldn't quite—</p>
<p>"—and I told her, 'Eleanor would have good advice about this.' You were always so organized when yours were that age."</p>
<p>When hers were what age? University age? Eleanor's children were... how old now? Michael was fifty-two. Jennifer was forty-nine. Not university age. Not for decades.</p>
<p>Grace was waiting for a response. Eleanor smiled. "I'm not sure I remember being that organized."</p>
<p>"Oh, you were. You had those color-coded calendars. Everything scheduled down to the minute." Grace laughed. "Gerald used to tease you about it."</p>
<p>Had she? Color-coded calendars? That sounded like something she'd do. But she couldn't picture it.</p>
<p>"Did I really?"</p>
<p>Grace's smile faltered. "You did. For years. Don't you remember?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Sorry. I was just—yes. The calendars." Eleanor waved a hand. "Ancient history now."</p>
<p>But Grace's eyes had sharpened. That look. The one that meant she'd noticed something.</p>
<p>"Are you sleeping all right?" Grace asked. "You look tired."</p>
<p>"Fine. Just the usual for this time of year. You know how it is."</p>
<p>"The holidays can be hard. First Christmas without..." Grace's voice went soft. "It's been five years, hasn't it?"</p>
<p>Five years since Gerald. That number was solid. Five years, four months, three days. Not that she was counting.</p>
<p>"I'm managing," Eleanor said.</p>
<p>"You always say that."</p>
<p>"Because it's true."</p>
<p>Grace looked at her for a long moment. "You'd tell me if you needed anything, wouldn't you? If something was wrong?"</p>
<p>The question hung in the air between them. Eleanor heard all the things it was really asking.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said. "Really. Just getting older. We all are."</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself. I'm aging like fine wine." Grace grinned, and the moment passed. They finished their tea, talked about nothing important—the church roof fund, Mrs. Parrish's ongoing war with the parish council, the weather.</p>
<p>Normal things. Normal conversation.</p>
<p>When Grace left, Eleanor stood at the window and watched her walk to her car. Competent Grace. Capable Grace. Grace who still drove without thinking about it, who still managed calendars and grandchildren and everything else without needing to write it all down.</p>
<p>Grace who would have noticed.</p>
<p>Eleanor turned away from the window. Fine. She was fine.</p>
<p>She checked the Day Book.</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 2:00 PM: Grace visited. Tea + biscuits. Nice catch-up. No problems.*</p>
<p>If she wrote it down, it was true.</p>

        <div class="chapter" id="chapter3">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: The List</h2>
<p>The days blurred together. Morning routines. Day Book checks. Meals that came from the instruction folder. Evenings in front of the television watching things she didn't follow.</p>
<p>Friday. Saturday. Sunday.</p>
<p>The church service on Sunday required special preparation. Eleanor laid out her church clothes on Saturday night—navy skirt, white blouse, the good cardigan. She wrote the routine in the Day Book with extra detail:</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Sunday, 15 December 2024*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 9:00 AM: Church clothes. Leave by 9:45 AM.*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 10:00 AM: Service (bring purse for collection).*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 11:15 AM: Coffee in church hall (stay 20 minutes, then polite exit).*</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• Remember: Smile. Greet people by name. Normal conversation.*</p>
<p>Remember to be normal.</p>
<p>She read the entry three times before bed, committing it to memory. Tomorrow she'd be fine. Tomorrow she'd manage.</p>
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
<p>Sunday morning went according to plan until it didn't.</p>
<p>The church was full—Advent season always drew bigger crowds. Eleanor found her usual spot in the fourth row, the end seat where Gerald used to sit beside her. She could do this. She'd sat through hundreds of services. She knew every word of every hymn, every line of every prayer.</p>
<p>The vicar began speaking. His voice carried through the stone space, familiar and steady. Eleanor focused on his words, on following along, on staying present.</p>
<p>The Lord's Prayer. She knew this one. Everyone knew this one.</p>
<p>"Our Father, who art in heaven..."</p>
<p>Her mouth formed the words along with the congregation. Automatic. Memorized since childhood.</p>
<p>"...hallowed be thy name..."</p>
<p>The words kept coming, but Eleanor's mind had stopped following. The sounds emerged from her mouth—she could hear herself saying them—but the meaning had evaporated. Phonemes. Syllables. Empty recitation.</p>
<p>"...thy kingdom come, thy will be done..."</p>
<p>When had these words stopped meaning anything? When had this prayer become just sounds, just muscle memory, just her mouth moving while her mind wandered somewhere else?</p>
<p>"...on earth as it is in heaven..."</p>
<p>Panic rose in her chest. She was speaking gibberish. Everyone would notice. They'd see that she'd forgotten the Lord's Prayer, that she couldn't even remember the words to the most basic—</p>
<p>But no. The words were coming out right. She could hear herself. She was saying them correctly, along with everyone else.</p>
<p>She just didn't know what they meant anymore.</p>
<p>The prayer ended. The congregation sat down. Eleanor sat down. Her hands gripped the pew in front of her, white-knuckled. She'd lost the entire prayer. Not the words—the meaning. The prayer had been muscle memory for sixty years and now it was just... nothing.</p>
<p>The service continued. The vicar kept talking. Eleanor heard sounds but couldn't piece them into sentences. She stood when others stood. Sat when others sat. Sang when the organ played, her voice following the melody on instinct.</p>
<p>When it ended, she filed out with everyone else. Smiles. Greetings. <em>Lovely service.</em> <em>Yes, beautiful music.</em> <em>See you next week.</em></p>
<p>The church hall coffee felt impossible. Too many people. Too many conversations. Too many chances to say something wrong, to forget someone's name, to lose track of what she was supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Eleanor found a quiet corner and held her tea. She'd stay the required twenty minutes. Then she'd leave.</p>
<p>"Eleanor! How wonderful to see you!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Patterson. That was definitely Mrs. Patterson. Enthusiastic, well-meaning, the kind of person who wanted to fix everything.</p>
<p>"How lovely to see you," Eleanor said. Automatic.</p>
<p>"We've missed you! You haven't been to the Christmas planning committee. Are you too busy?"</p>
<p>Christmas planning committee. Had she been on that? She used to organize things. She used to be on committees. But recently...</p>
<p>"I've been..." What? What had she been doing? "...taking some time to myself. You know how it is."</p>
<p>"Of course, of course. Especially this time of year. It must be hard." Mrs. Patterson's hand on Eleanor's arm. Sympathetic eyes. "But we'd love to have you back. Would you consider joining us for the carol service planning? We need someone to coordinate the readings."</p>
<p>Coordinate. The word felt impossible. Coordinate meant organizing, scheduling, remembering who was doing what when.</p>
<p>"I'll have to check my calendar," Eleanor said.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! I'll call you. We meet Tuesdays at two."</p>
<p>Mrs. Patterson moved on to talk to someone else. Eleanor exhaled. She'd survived. Normal conversation. Nothing strange. She'd check the Day Book when she got home, make a note about Tuesdays at two, and then when Mrs. Patterson called, Eleanor would politely decline. Too busy. Prior commitments. Something.</p>
<p>The twenty minutes passed. Eleanor made her polite exit and walked to the car park. Other people clustered in groups, chatting, laughing. Normal Sunday morning. Normal church. Normal people with normal lives.</p>
<p>Eleanor unlocked her car and sat in the driver's seat. Her hands shook too much to immediately start the engine. She gripped the steering wheel and breathed. In. Out. In. Out.</p>
<p>She'd gotten through it. No one had noticed. She'd seemed normal.</p>
<p>Seemed.</p>
<p>That was the word that mattered. Seemed. Not was. Seemed.</p>
<p>She drove home carefully. Ten miles under the speed limit. Both hands on the wheel.</p>
<p>At Rose Cottage, she wrote in the Day Book:</p>
<p class="no-indent" style="padding-left: 2rem;">• 11:45 AM: Home from church. Service went well. Talked to Mrs. Patterson. No problems.*</p>
<p>The lie sat there in blue ink, permanent and false.</p>
<p>But if she wrote it down, it became true.</p>
